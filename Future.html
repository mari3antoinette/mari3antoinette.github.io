            Perhaps it is a weird concept George Orwell had in his book 1984, but who knows maybe society will really develop in that way. How can we distinguish between utopia and dystopia when we look at a certain society? For example, in Orwell’s book he said that society with no privacy and watched by the government is a dystopian society. Here we can make a parallelism between the society we live in and the society in the book.
            Surrounded by phones, young people can’t take their eyes away from a piece of glass that connects them with the whole world.
            In the past people thought that incompetent and foolish people were behaving in that way because of the lack of information. We can state that’s not why people behaved that way.
            Let’s go little back in history, when we humans lived in the caves and chased animals for food. People back then were happy from the smallest things like seeing a beautiful butterfly or catching something for dinner.
            As humans have developed with finding new inventions happiness should’ve been found from different things. Does a piece of glass make young people happy and how is that even possible? It’s not a secret that easy dopamine (the happy hormone) can be accessed through social media.
            Imagine just tapping twice on your phone makes you and your friend happy, but also addicted to as I referred before a piece of glass. So, lack of information is not anymore the issue, but the pool of billion informations are THE PROBLEM.
            In Orwell’s book they are controlled and watched by screens directly, while the same thing happens now but indirectly. Young people have the need to buy new clothes even if they don’t need them because they saw something on the internet and thought it’s best to buy the same thing because it’s a trend.  His book was published 8th of June 1949. His spectacular and genius brain predicted the future.
        <br>But this is not a future worth living for. With the development of Facebook, now known as Meta, they are planning on making VR world where you can make your own home, buy your own furniture with cryptocurrency etc.
        Would you rather want to live in a reality where you don’t have enough money for food or live in a virtual reality where you have 3 floor apartments? The world will downgrade itself; people will be more conformists and lazy. Sadly, not many people have realized that “if the product is free, then you are the product”. Instead of your phone being a tool you are in constant need of it and checking it approximately from 58 to 344 times per day.
        More absurd than that is that 5h are wasted on the phone and for no good cause.
        <br>The future could improve in two ways, if people stopped using their phones so much or known as having a common sense, or companies making the apps less addictive or demanding payment for every minute spent on their app.
        <br>If George Orwell was still alive, he would be disappointed that his dystopian novel became reality.
